- How to change user parameters
    You can modify parameters in NeuralNetworkConfig.bsv
    
    * Parameter description
      - PixelBitSz: Input/weight bit size (Default : 16)
      - NumPERows, NumPEColumns: to modify the number of PEs. 
        + You need to make the number of PEs to be the power of 2 to get microswitch network work
        + For RS traffic, NumPEColumns should be greater or equal than the FilterSz.
      - PEdelay: the delay of each PE
      - NumChannels, NuMFilters, NumIfMaps, FilterSz, IfMapSz, Stride: Defines the dimension of the target convolution layer to simulate.
        + Please note that it is necessary information for reconfiguration controller and the traffic generator.
        + To run another layer, you need to modify the parameter and compile the simulation again.

- How to run the compilation

    make verilog  : generate Verilog RTL in ./MSVerilog/
    make run      : run a complied simulation
    make clean    : clean up build files

  * To run the compiler and simulation, you need Bluespec System Verilog (www.bluespec.com) compiler
