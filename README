Lab assignment code for three-day lecture, "Designing CNN Accelerators using Bluespec System Verilog", given in Seoul National University in December 2017.

For lab assignment descriptions, please refer to slides in /documents directory.

* These lab assignements are based on Bluespec System Verilog (http://bluespec.com).
	You need Bluespec compiler license to run simulations for lab assignments.
	Bluespec offers university program: please refer to the website (http://bluespec.com/university/)

* Compiling code
In each lab, I added a make file that launches compilation script with right option.
	> make : Compile Blue-sim cycle accurate simulation
	> make run : Run the compiled simulation
	> make clean : Clean up build files
	
* How to add vim syntax?
	> mkdir ~/.vim
	> cp -r vim_syntax/* ~/.vim
